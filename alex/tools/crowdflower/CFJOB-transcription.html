The audio tracks you will be transcribing contain one part of a telephone conversation. The telephone conversation
takes place in New York and the caller is looking for a public transport information. In case the track is fuzzy 
beyond comprehension (e.g. distant echo of the other side), You should fill a symbol that best describes it 
(table down below).
</p>
<p>
Please, try to transcribe as well as possible,<em style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">if there is a faulty 
transcription found, You will not be able to collect your reward.</em> The test questions are very strict! 
Please read Your transcription before you send, a lot of typos (from -&gt; fron) etc. It's unfortunate, but it
happens a lot and contributors are all annoyed that that's exactly what they've written, but it's not!
Listen to it more than once if you're not rock solid!
</p>
<p>
Write the transcriptions in<strong>LOWER CASE</strong>without punctuation, which means 
<strong>NO COMMAS!</strong> <em>(apostrophe allowed)</em> and please, write <strong>WORDS FOR NUMBERS</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Example: "<strong style="color: green;">goodbye</strong>", 
not "<strong style="color: red;">Good bye</strong>" and NOT "<strong style="color: red;">good-bye</strong>"
<br>
Example: "<strong style="color: green;">you're</strong>", not "<strong style="color: red;">You're</strong>", 
not "<strong style="color: red;">youre</strong>" and not "<strong style="color: red;">you are</strong>" 
(unless <em>are</em> is explicitly pronounced of course)
<br>
Only <strong style="color: green;">a-z</strong> and <strong style="color: green;">' ( )</strong> are 
allowed (lowercase, apostrophe and parenthesis).
</p>

<p>
Write what You hear (or deduce), imagine You're a brilliant Google Automatic Speech Recognizer.
</p>

<p>
For non-comprehensible tracks please use the following symbols (including the parentheses!):
</p>

<table style="margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:2em;border-bottom-width:1.5pt;border-bottom-style:solid;border-top-width:1.5pt;border-top-style:solid;border-spacing:1em;border-collapse:collapse">
<tbody>
<tr style="border-bottom-width:1pt;border-bottom-style:solid">
<th style="padding:5px">symbol</th>
<th style="padding:5px 5px 5px 2em">meaning</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="padding:5px">(noise)</td>
<td style="padding:5px 5px 5px 2em">noise&nbsp;on the background</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="padding:5px">(sil)</td>
<td style="padding:5px 5px 5px 2em">silence if it is prominent or if there is nothing else to transcribe</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="padding:5px">(unint)</td>

<td style="padding:5px 5px 5px 2em">unintelligible speech</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
To save You a lot of headache, here's words You will hear, don't change spelling, the test questions are 
uncompromising.
<br>
<em style="color: green;">junction boulevard, queens, atlantic terminal, three o'clock, time requirements, 
weather forecast, duration of the trip, distance, number of transfers, find a connection, las vegas, nevada, 
thank you goodbye, quicker route, hello.</em>
<br>
Those are not transcriptions, those are just examples of what you might hear and for defining the spelling!
Be sure to understand how the apostrophe should be included. If<em>it's</em>obviously short write apostrophe, 
if<em>it is</em>obviously a full form, write a full form. You might be surprised how listening two times makes 
"one time (unint)" clear enough to put in a correct answer.
